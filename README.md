# Q-Learning CartPole Simulation

This repository contains an implementation of a reinforcement learning agent using the Q-Learning algorithm to solve the classic **CartPole-v1** control problem from OpenAI Gym. The objective of the CartPole task is to balance a pole on a moving cart by learning an optimal action policy through trial and error.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of model-free reinforcement learning, environment interaction, reward-based learning, and performance tracking. It is ideal for anyone studying or building projects in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Installation and Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following dependencies:

- numpy
- gym (or gymnasium)
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy gym matplotlib

#for gymnasium:
```bash
pip install numpy gymnasium matplotlib

#run this to train the agent :
```bash
python ai_runner.py
